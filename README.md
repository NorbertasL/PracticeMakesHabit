# Practice Makes Habits (PMH)

## Goal of the App
The goal of PMH is to let people set up lists of small tasks that they want to
achieve daily/weekly/monthly. It will have a built-in reminder system to remind them
about the task, and a way to mark it as complete.The goal is to make those tasks 
part of your daily/weekly/monthly routine and form habits from them.

## How to use the app efficiently 
The task needs to be simple and preferably short.You brain is lazy and if you set up long complex tasks it
will be very reluctant to do them, and you will fail at forming a habit. <br>
Example:You want to read more books.So your daily task would be to read 5 min a day.I know that 5 min
sounds like nothing and that is the point. It sounds easy, so it is easy to start.Once you have done you 5 min
you are free to keep on reading until the end of the chapter, or until you get tired.The 5 min minimal is 
there to get you started and to trick the brain into doing something productive.

## GUI Design
For the GUI I will be using JavaFX and IntelliJ Scene Builder.
