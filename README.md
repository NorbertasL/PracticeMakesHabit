# Practice Makes Habits (PMH)

## Goal of the App
The goal of PMH is to let people set up lists of small tasks that they want to
achieve daily/weekly/monthly. It will have a build in reminder system to remind you
about the task, and a way to mark it complete.The goal is to make those tasks 
part of your daily/weekly/monthly routine and form habits from them.

## How to use the app efficiently 
The task need to be simple and preferably short.You brain is lazy and if tou set up long complex tasks it
will be very resistant to do them, and you will fail at forming a habit. <br>
Example:You want to read more books.So your daily task would be to read 5 min a day.I know tht 5 min
sounds like nothing, but that it point.It sounds easy, so it is easy to start.Once you have done you 5 min
you are free to keep on reading until the end of the chapter, or until you get tier.The 5min minimal is 
there to get you started and to trick the brain into doing something productive.
